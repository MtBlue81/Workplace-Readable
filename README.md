#### After

![Content Area (after)](image/feature3_after.png)

Make posts easier to read by expanding the width of content area.
You can focus on post contents which is the main contents of Workplace.

Also, by applying liquid design, the width of the content area will be resized according to the window width.

### <a name="feature4"></a>4. Move "Trending Posts" from "Right Column" to the content area

#### Before

![Trending Posts (before)](image/feature4_before.png)

#### After

![Trending Posts (after)](image/feature4_after.png)

Since "Right Column" will be hidden, move "Trending Posts" from "Right Column" to the content area.
As a secondary effect, since "Trending Posts" area expands, post contents will not be ommitted.

### <a name="feature5"></a>5. Place "Expand All" in each user content

![Expand All](image/feature5.png)

For each post, place a "Expand All" button to expand the collapsed post.

In Workplace, contents with long sentences and more than a certain number of comments are appropriately omitted.
In order to display omitted content, you need to click on the following link one by one. It's too much hassle.

- See More
- View previous comments
- View x more comments
- x Replies

Clicking on "Expand All" button, the collapsed post expands automatically and you can check all the omitted contents.

### <a name="feature6"></a>6. Place "Scroll to Top" button at the bottom right of the page

![Scroll to Top](image/feature6.png)

Place "Scroll to Top" button at the bottom right of the page (the content area in a strict sense).

### <a name="feature7"></a>7. Highlight mentions to me a little

![Mentions to Me](image/feature7.png)

Highlight mentions to me a little.
It becomes easy to notice a bit for mentions to me that tends to overlook.

### <a name="feature8"></a>8. Highlight "Recent Activity" and "Older" headings a little

#### Before

![Headings](image/feature8_before.png)

#### After

![Headings](image/feature8_after.png)

With highlighting "RECENT ACTIVITY / OLDER (POST) / PINNED POST" headings a little,
you can avoid the situation that "I intended to browse only the latest posts, but I was reading past ones without even noticing".

### <a name="feature9"></a>9. Highlight subheadings a little in "Left Column"

#### Before

![Subheaddings (before)](image/feature9_before.png)

#### After

![Subheaddings (after)](image/feature9_after.png)

Highlight subheadings a little in "Left Column" by putting a separator line.
That's all.
